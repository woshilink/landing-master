			£50 bonus.
		</li>
		<li>
			The bonus is automatically credited to your sports betting account as soon as your deposit has been rolled over once (x1) with odds of at least 1.60 and all
			qualifying bets have been settled.
		</li>
		<li>
			After entering the bonus code in the cashier you have 24 hours to make your deposit. After this time the bonus code will expire.
		</li>
		<li>
			Rollover of your deposit (x1) is to activate the bonus only. This does not count towards your total rollover requirement.
		</li>
		<li>
			All rollover is only contributed to when the bets have been SETTLED.
		</li>
		<li>
			You must complete your rollover within 60 days of your initial deposit. If the rollover is not completed, any funds held in your bonus balance will be
			forfeited.
		</li>
		<li>
			All Rollover must be complete before you can withdraw (or transfer any winnings to casino platforms) otherwise any bonus or winnings made from it will be
			forfeited.
		</li>
		<li>
			All rollover must be on sporting events with odds of at least 1.60 (for combination/system bets each selection must also be with odds of at least 1.60).
		</li>
		<li>
			If you still have rollover to complete on an existing bonus, you must clear it meeting the specific wagering requirements of that bonus, before completing
			rollover on your next bonus.

			Single bets placed on any type of Handicap or Under/Over markets will not contribute towards completing the rollover, however Combi bets can include all bet
			types as long as the minimum odds are respected for each individual selection.

		<li>
			Multiple bets placed on the same event will not count towards rollover and also considered as bonus manipulation and your bonus will be removed.
