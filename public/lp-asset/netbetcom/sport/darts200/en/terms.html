		<li>Multiple bets placed on the same event will not count towards rollover and also considered as bonus manipulation and your bonus will be removed.</li>

		<li>After entering the bonus code in the cashier you have 24 hours to make your deposit. After this time the bonus code will expire.</li>
		<li>Rollover of your deposit (x1) is to activate the bonus only. This does not count towards your total rollover requirement.</li>

		<li>Depositing more than is needed to obtain the maximum bonus amount will add more rollover requirement than is necessary. For example if your account is in EUR then depositing more than 200EUR to receive a maximum 100EUR bonus will add more rollover requirement</li>
